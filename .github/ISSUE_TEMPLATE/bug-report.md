### Version information

Please include both the PhotoDemon version (found in the `Help > About` menu) and Windows version, if you know it (e.g. "Windows 11").

### Describe the bug

The more detailed, the better.

### How can I reproduce the bug?

Again, the more detailed, the better.  A clear list of steps is especially helpful:
   1. Go to '...'
   2. Click on '...'
   3. Etc

### Expected behavior

Please describe what *should* happen.  (This is especially helpful if you're accustomed to another app's behavior - let me know what they do and I'll study it!)

### Debug logs

If you are using a nightly build, or if PhotoDemon has crashed more than once, it will automatically generate Debug Logs inside the program's `Data/Debug` folder.  If you can zip up all files in that folder and attach them to this bug report, that is a *huge* help.

### Sample images and/or screenshots

If applicable, please attach the image file(s) that caused the bug.  Screenshots or screen recordings of the problem can also help.  (PhotoDemon provides a built-in screen recording tool in the `Tools > Animated screen capture` menu.)

### Thank you!

As a "thank you" for your help, I am happy to add your name to PhotoDemon's contributor list.  Please let me know what name (and optional website link) you'd like me to use.
