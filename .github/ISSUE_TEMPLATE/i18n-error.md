### What language does this affect?

### Where does the bad translation appear?

Screenshots are very helpful.  PhotoDemon provides a built-in screenshot tool in the `File > Import > Screenshot` menu, or you can click the `Print Screen` button on your keyboard, then `Ctrl+V` (paste) the results directly into this box.

### What does the text currently say, and what should it be changed to?

You can also directly modify the appropriate PhotoDemon language file (found in the `App/PhotoDemon/Languages` subfolder) and attach your modified file to this issue.

### Thank you!

As a "thank you" for your help, I am happy to add your name to PhotoDemon's contributor list.  Please let me know what name (and optional website link) you'd like me to use.
